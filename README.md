# 📊 Chi-Square Test Analysis

## 🔹 Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the **Chi-Square Test of Independence**, a statistical method used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.  

By working through this notebook, I explore the importance of hypothesis testing in statistics and its applications in real-world data analysis.

## 🔹 Objectives
- Perform **Chi-Square Test of Independence** on a dataset.  
- Test the **null hypothesis** and evaluate statistical significance.  
- Interpret results to understand associations between categorical variables.  
- Build a foundation for applying statistical methods in **data-driven decision making**.  

---

## 🔹 Steps Covered
1. **Importing Libraries & Dataset**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on categorical features  
3. Applying the **Chi-Square Test**  
4. Interpreting the results (p-value, significance level, hypothesis conclusion)

## 🔹 Key Learnings
- Understanding **statistical hypothesis testing**.  
- Practical implementation of **Chi-Square** using Python.  
- Realizing how categorical relationships can guide insights in business, healthcare, and research.  

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- SciPy  
- NumPy  

---

## 🔹 Future Scope
- Extend the analysis to larger datasets with multiple categorical variables.  
- Visualize associations using **heatmaps** and **contingency tables**.  
- Compare with other statistical tests like **t-tests** and **ANOVA**.
